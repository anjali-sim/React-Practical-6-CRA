# React-Practical-6 using CRA

- In this Practical, I have used .env files for declaring environment variables for different stages.
- I have defined three different .env files for development, staging and production.
- I have used CRA for configuring the environment variables.
- In package.json, I have defined the different builds for the environment variables.
- I have installed env-cmd and serve in it for its management.
